	author = {M. A. Pereira  and C. A. Duarte and I. Exarchos and E. A. Theodorou},
	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning based solution to the Powered-Descent Guidance (PDG) problem, grounded in principles of nonlinear Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) and Feynman-Kac theory. Our algorithm solves the PDG problem by framing it as an L1 SOC problem for minimum fuel consumption. Additionally, it can handle practically useful control constraints, nonlinear dynamics and enforces state constraints as soft-constraints. This is achieved by building off of recent work on deep Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) and differentiable non-convex optimization neural-network layers based on stochastic search. In contrast to previous approaches, our algorithm does not require convexification of the constraints or linearization of the dynamics and is empirically shown to be robust to stochastic disturbances and the initial position of the spacecraft. After training offline, our controller can be activated once the spacecraft is within a pre-specified radius of the landing zone and at a pre-specified altitude i.e., the base of an inverted cone with the tip at the landing zone. We demonstrate empirically that our controller can successfully and safely land all trajectories initialized at the base of this cone while minimizing fuel consumption.},

	abstract = {Soft robot serial chain manipulators with the capability for growth, stiffness control, and discrete joints have the potential to approach the dexterity of traditional robot arms, while improving safety, lowering cost, and providing an increased workspace, with potential application in home environments. This paper presents an approach for design optimization of such robots to reach specified targets while minimizing the number of discrete joints and thus construction and actuation costs. We define a maximum number of allowable joints, as well as hardware constraints imposed by the materials and actuation available for soft growing robots, and we formulate and solve an optimization problem to output a planar robot design, i.e., the total number of potential joints and their locations along the robot body, which reaches all the desired targets, avoids known obstacles, and maximizes the workspace. We demonstrate a process to rapidly construct the resulting soft growing robot design. Finally, we use our algorithm to evaluate the ability of this design to reach new targets and demonstrate the algorithm's utility as a design tool to explore robot capabilities given various constraints and objectives.},

By taking advantage of the permutation-invariant property of agents in symmetric games, the scalability and performance is further enhanced significantly. We showcase superior performance of our framework over the state-of-the-art deep fictitious play algorithm on an inter-bank lending/borrowing problem in terms of multiple metrics. More importantly, our approach scales up to 3000 agents in simulation, a scale which, to the best of our knowledge, represents a new state-of-the-art.

Specifically, for an objective function located at some layer in the network and parameterized by some network parameters, we employ adaptive stochastic search to perform optimization over its output. This operation is differentiable and does not obstruct the passing of gradients during backpropagation, thus enabling us to incorporate it as a component in end-to-end learning. We study the proposed optimization module's properties and benchmark it against two existing alternatives on a synthetic energy-based structured prediction task, and further showcase its use in stochastic optimal control applications.},

	abstract = {Transferring reinforcement learning policies trained in physics simulation to the real hardware remains a challenge, known as the "sim-to-real" gap. Domain randomization is a simple yet effective technique to address dynamics discrepancies across source and target domains, but its success generally depends on heuristics and trial-and-error. In this work we investigate the impact of randomized parameter selection on policy transferability across different types of domain discrepancies. Contrary to common practice in which kinematic parameters are carefully measured while dynamic parameters are randomized, we found that virtually randomizing kinematic parameters (e.g., link lengths) during training in simulation generally outperforms dynamic randomization. Based on this finding, we introduce a new domain adaptation algorithm that utilizes simulated kinematic parameters variation. Our algorithm, Multi-Policy Bayesian Optimization, trains an ensemble of universal policies conditioned on virtual kinematic parameters and efficiently adapts to the target environment using a limited number of target domain rollouts. We showcase our findings on a simulated quadruped robot in five different target environments covering different aspects of domain discrepancies.},

By factoring the DASH system into a vision module, a language module, and manipulation modules of two skill categories, we can mix and match analytical and machine learning techniques for different modules so that DASH is able to not only perform randomly arranged tasks with a high success rate, but also do so under anthropomorphic constraints and with fluid and diverse motions.

Our differentiable physics engine offers a complete set of features that are typically only available in non-differentiable physics simulators commonly used by robotics applications.

We present efficient and novel analytical gradients through the LCP formulation of inelastic contact that exploit the sparsity of the LCP solution. We support complex contact geometry, and gradients approximating continuous-time elastic collision. We also introduce a novel method to compute complementarityaware gradients that help downstream optimization tasks avoid stalling in saddle points. We show that an implementation of this combination in an existing physics engine (DART) is capable of a 45x single-core speedup over finite-differencing in computing analytical Jacobians for a single timestep, while preserving all the expressiveness of original DART.},

	author = {Exarchos, Ioannis and Rogers, Anna A and Aiani, Lauren M and Gross, Robert E and Clifford, Gari D and Pedersen, Nigel P and Willie, Jon T},
	abstract = {Despite commercial availability of software to facilitate sleep-wake scoring of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) in animals, automated scoring of rodent models of abnormal sleep, such as narcolepsy with cataplexy, has remained elusive. We optimize two machine-learning approaches, supervised and unsupervised, for automated scoring of behavioral states in orexin/ataxin-3 transgenic mice, a validated model of narcolepsy type 1, and additionally test them on wild-type mice. The supervised learning approach uses previously labeled data to facilitate training of a classifier for sleep states, whereas the unsupervised approach aims to discover latent structure and similarities in unlabeled data from which sleep stages are inferred. For the supervised approach, we employ a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is trained on expert-labeled segments of wake, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep in EEG/EMG time series data. The resulting trained classifier is then used to infer on the labels of previously unseen data. For the unsupervised approach, we leverage data dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. Both approaches successfully score EEG/EMG data, achieving mean accuracies of 95\% and 91\%, respectively, in narcoleptic mice, and accuracies of 93\% and 89\%, respectively, in wild-type mice. Notably, the supervised approach generalized well on previously unseen data from the same animals on which it was trained but exhibited lower performance on animals not present in the training data due to inter-subject variability. Cataplexy is scored with a sensitivity of 85\% and 57\% using the supervised and unsupervised approaches, respectively, when compared to manual scoring, and the specificity exceeds 99\% in both cases.},

	author = {Park, Sang-Eon and Connolly, Mark J and Exarchos, Ioannis and Fernandez, Alejandra and Ghetiya, Mihir and Gutekunst, Claire-Anne and Gross, Robert E},
	abstract = {Objective: Developing a new neuromodulation method for epilepsy treatment requires a large amount of time and resources to find effective stimulation parameters and often fails due to inter-subject variability in stimulation effect. As an alternative, we present a novel data-driven surrogate approach which can optimize the neuromodulation efficiently by investigating the stimulation effect on surrogate neural states. Approach: Medial septum (MS) optogenetic stimulation was applied for modulating electrophysiological activities of the hippocampus in a rat temporal lobe epilepsy model. For the new approach, we implemented machine learning techniques to describe the pathological neural states and to optimize the stimulation parameters. Specifically, first, we found neural state surrogates to estimate a seizure susceptibility based on hippocampal local field potentials. Second, we modulated the neural state surrogates in a desired way with the subject-specific optimal stimulation parameters found by in vivo Bayesian optimization. Finally, we tested whether modulating the neural state surrogates affected seizure frequency. Main results: We found two neural state surrogates: The first was hippocampal theta power by considering its well-known relationship with epilepsy, and the second was the output of pre-ictal state model (PriSM) which was built by characterizing the hippocampal activity during the pre-ictal period. The optimal stimulation parameters found by Bayesian optimization outperformed the other parameters in terms of modulating the surrogates toward anti-seizure neural state. When treatment efficacy was tested, the subject-specific optimal parameters for increasing theta power were more effective to suppress seizures than fixed stimulation parameter (7 Hz). However, modulation of the other neural state surrogate, PriSM, did not suppress seizures. Significance: The surrogate approach can save enormous time and resources to find subject-specific optimal stimulation parameters which can effectively modulate neural states and further improve therapeutic effectiveness. This approach can also be used for improving neuromodulation treatment of other neurological or psychiatric diseases.},

The differential dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm is implemented in a model predictive fashion to optimize a controller for suppressing seizures in a chaotic oscillator model. The chaotic oscillator model uses proportional-integral (PI) controller to represent the internal control mechanism that maintains stable neural activity in a healthy brain. In the pathological case, the gains of this PI controller are reduced, preventing sufficient feedback to suppress correlation increase between normal and pathological brain dynamics. This increase in correlation leads to synchronization of oscillator dynamics leading to the destabilization of neural activity and epileptic behavior. The pathological case of the chaotic oscillator model is formulated as an optimal control problem, which we solve using the dynamic programming principle. We propose using model predictive control with differential dynamic programming optimization as a possible method for controlling epileptic seizures in known models of epilepsy.},
