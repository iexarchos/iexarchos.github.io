Hi, I'm Ioannis Exarchos, though I usually go by *Yannis*.
I am a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft. Prior to that I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the computer science department of Stanford University. I received a PhD degree in 2017 from the Georgia Institue of Technology, and also hold two MS degrees, in Mathematics and Aerospace Engineering, also from Georgia Tech. My initial degree was in Mechanical Engineering, obtained at the University of Patras, Greece (where I graduated at the top of my class and was appointed valedictorian). My doctoral thesis was in the field of stochastic optimal control, under the guidance of profs. Panagiotis Tsiotras and Evangelos Theodorou. After the completion of my PhD I spent some time developing machine learning and control algorithms for a neuroscience/neurosurgery lab at Emory University, and then joined Stanford University to work on control and deep reinforcement learning for robotics with prof. C. Karen Liu. My research interests lie at the intersection of stochastic control, reinforcement learning, optimization, and deep learning, particularly in applications within robotics and neuroscience. I also have some background in differential game theory. During my PhD studies I was an [Onassis Foundation](https://www.onassis.org/) scholar.

In my free time I enjoy reading books (both non-fiction as well as classic literature; see my reading journal [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66041354-yannis/)!), Jiu Jitsu and yoga to offset the time spent sitting at a desk, and playing the piano whenever I get the chance.
