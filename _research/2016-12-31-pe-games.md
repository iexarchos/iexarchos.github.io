We published a few papers on multi-agent pursuit evasion games. Using the differential game theory framework developed by R. Isaacs, we analyzed a game in which a less maneuverable (but potentially faster) agent is pursued by an agile agent. We determined initial conditions that lead to capture and obtained optimal controls and capture times. Using these results, we then developed a collision avoidance framework that considers the worst case of a malicious opponent that is attempting to cause a collision.  

The results were published in the Journal of Dynamic Games and Applications, the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, as well as the AIAA SciTech Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference.
